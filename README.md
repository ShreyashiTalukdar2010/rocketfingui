# Rocket Fin Simulator GUI

**How does fin shape affect rocket stability?**
This project explores that question by combining physics, math, and code into an interactive GUI simulator. Built with Python + Tkinter + Matplotlib, the tool lets users experiment with rocket launches under different conditions and see how fin design impacts trajectory.

## Features

* **Angle & Speed sliders** — adjust initial launch conditions.
* **Fin shape selector** — compare stability across multiple fin designs.
* **Mass input** — tweak rocket weight and watch the difference.
* **Wind toggle** — simulate crosswinds on rocket flight.
* **Race mode** — launch all fins together and crown a winner.
* **Live stats & end summary** — see max height, range, and flight time.
* **Coloured trails** — each fin has its own trajectory color.
* **Victory banner** — displays the winning fin.
* **Landing effects** — fun little "explosions" when rockets hit the ground.

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.12**
* **Tkinter** (GUI)
* **Matplotlib** (plotting trajectories)
* **NumPy** (math & physics calculations)

## Physics Behind It

* Projectile motion equations with drag.
* Drag coefficient varies by **fin shape**.
* Air resistance modeled with simplified quadratic drag.
* Adjustable parameters for angle, velocity, and mass.

## Future Improvements

* 3D rocket flight visualization.
* More fin geometries with real-world coefficients.
* Export data to CSV for further analysis.
* Integration with Arduino sensors for real-world launches (!).

## Why This Project?

I wanted to understand rocket stability not just in theory (*mind*), but through interactive simulation (*hand*). This project bridges physics equations with a playful tool, making aerodynamics more approachable for learners and hobbyists.

MIT’s motto is *Mens et Manus* (Mind and Hand) — this project is my little version of that.
